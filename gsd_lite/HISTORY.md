# GSD-Lite History

<!--
MINIMAL record of completed phases.
One line per phase - just enough to know what was done.
Details live in external artifacts (PRs, docs, etc.)
-->

## Completed Phases

| Phase | Name | Completed | Outcome |
|-------|------|-----------|---------|

1. Add one-line entry above
2. Link to external artifact (PR, doc, etc.)
3. Delete WORK.md content
